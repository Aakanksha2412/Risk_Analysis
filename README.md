# 🛡️ Comparative Risk Analysis: Human Error in Crisis Response  

**Author:** Aakanksha Sonawane 
**Course:** Enterprise Risk Management  
**Instructor:** Prof. Frank Marullo  

## 📘 Overview  
This project explores the role of human error in large-scale crises by comparing two major incidents:
- **BP** – Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill  
- **Public Health England (PHE)** – COVID-19 Data Loss Incident

The analysis uses the Risk Management Process Model to assess preparedness, mitigation, and leadership response in both public and private sectors.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways  
- Human error without proper system redundancy can trigger operational disasters.  
- Effective crisis response requires both technical safeguards and leadership accountability.  
- Risk frameworks must evolve to address data integrity, communication, and proactive strategy.

## 📊 Learning Outcomes  
As a future leader, this project helped me:  
- Identify operational blind spots due to human error.  
- Recommend enhancements in organizational risk frameworks.  
- Emphasize transparent communication and fast resolution during crises.
